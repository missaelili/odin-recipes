    <p>An authentic Mexican dish - chicken slow cooked in a delectable sauce of chiles with a rich, never overpowering, chocolate background. Wonderful served with warm corn tortillas, rice and beans. Plan to have quite a mess to clean up afterward!</p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 dried mulato chiles</li>
        <li>4 dried ancho chiles</li>
        <li>4 dried guajillo chiles</li>
        <li>4 dried pasilla chilies</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lard, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (7 inch) flour tortilla</li>
        <li>2 (5 inch) corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 plantain, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup almonds</li>
        <li>½ cup peanuts</li>
        <li>⅛ cup sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablet of Mexican chocolate, such as Abuelita or Ibarra</li>
        <li>1 whole chicken </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the stems, veins and seeds from the chiles (you might want to wear gloves when you do this). Heat the lard in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the chiles, and cook and stir until the chiles are fragrant, about 1 minute, being careful not to burn them. Remove the chiles and place them in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir in the onion and garlic, and cook until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove and add to the bowl with the chiles.</li>
        <li>Break the flour and corn tortillas into pieces, and add them to the skillet. Toast on both sides, turning often, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove; add to the bowl.</li>
        <li>If needed, melt a small amount of additional lard in the skillet. Add the plantain pieces to the skillet, and cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove plantain; add to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir the almonds and peanuts into the skillet, and cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Sprinkle in the sesame seeds and continue cooking until sesame seeds are lightly browned, 15-30 seconds. Remove; add to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Warm the tomatoes over medium heat in the skillet until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Break the chocolate into chunks and stir into the tomatoes until melted. Pour the chocolate and tomato mixture into the bowl with the chile mixture; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Working in small batches, puree the mixture in a blender until smooth, adding a small amount of water if needed to make a smooth sauce.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken into a large Dutch oven; pour the sauce over the chicken. Cover and simmer over medium low heat until the chicken falls off the bone, 2-3 hours.</li>
